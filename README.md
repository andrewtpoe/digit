# Neural Networks and Deep Learning (in JavaScript)

This repository contains the code from the book, "Neural Networks and Deep
Learning". The original code is written in Python 2.x, and can be found in the
`/original` directory.

As a part of translating the original source to JavaScript, I've attempted to
break apart the terse code. It most likely runs slower, it should be a bit
simpler for less familiar developers to digest.
